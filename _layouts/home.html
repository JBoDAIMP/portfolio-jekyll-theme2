    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am Janice and having  completed a mathematics and business degree in South Africa, I moved to London to work in global financial services.</p>
    <p>I have recently build a global data warehouse for regulatory reporting.</p>
    <p>I enjoy learning new things and as I am just about to complete a data analyst course.</p>
    <p>Once complete, I would like to use my skills to analyse data I collect to thereby create more accurate and complete datasets.</p>
    <p>Personally, I like to walk, ski, travel with friend and family.</p>
